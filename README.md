# Fibonacci and Merge Sort

This project practices problem-solving with iteration and recursion by working on two classic problems: generating Fibonacci sequences and implementing Merge Sort.

## Features

- **`fibs(n)`**: Iteratively generates the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.
- **`fibsRec(n)`**: Recursively generates the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.
- **`mergeSort(array)`**: Recursively sorts an array using the Merge Sort algorithm.

## Notes

- `mergeSort` repeatedly splits arrays and merges them back in sorted order.

## Testing

Each function can be tested by calling it with different inputs and checking the output.
